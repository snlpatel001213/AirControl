# Welcome to Aircontrol

**AirControl is an Open Source, Modular, Cross-Platform, and Extensible Flight Simulator For Deep Learning Research.** Airsim offers a realistic simulation experience with a variety of airplanes. The Airsim is built on [Unity Game engine](https://unity.com). Following are the salient features of the Aircontrol:

* Built with **C#**, it has **Python** API to control it from your favorite Deep learning Framework.
* Complete source code is open on Github.
* Aircontrol takes full advantage of object-oriented programming. Developed fully modular from day one. You can easily introduce new features such as **vertical takeoff**. you can bring your own **alien plane to AirCotrol**. 
* AirControl is truly cross-platform, can be compiled on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Binary will be released for all the platforms.
* The AirControl uses Nvidia [Physx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhysX) for the best possible Newtonian physics simulation.
* Aircontrol allows users to take advantage of aerodynamics effects such as [Ground effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(aerodynamics)).
* All the control surfaces (Throttle, Rudder, Ailerons, and Flaps) accepts normalized input between -1 and 1. This makes Aircontrol even more friendly with AI.

## System Requirement
It depends on how big your Unity Environment is. The environmant which comes with the Aircontrol binary releases is the basic one and tested with following config:

- Operating system : Ubuntu, Windows, Mac
- CPU: Intel Core i7
- GPU: Nvidia 1070 or Higher
- RAM: 16 GB
- Flight Controller: xbox [WIP] expected release v0.0.7

Aircontrol may work with lower than the specified requirements, but its not tested.

You can run Aircontrol in server-client mode in two different machines or both in the single machine.

## Research Inspirations
  
**Feel free to list your research topic you love to work on over here. Collaborate and publish.**
  
1. On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549, an Airbus A320 on a flight from New York City's LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, North Carolina, struck a flock of birds shortly after take-off, losing all engine power. Unable to reach any airport for an emergency landing due to their low altitude, pilots Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger and Jeffrey Skiles glided the plane to a ditching in the Hudson River off Midtown Manhattan. **Well! Sully did the best but Could we have a different outcome, If Reinforcement learning was controlling this plane?**. [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways_Flight_1549)
