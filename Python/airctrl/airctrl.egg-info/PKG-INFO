# Welcome to AirControl

**AirControl is an Open Source, Modular, Cross-Platform, and Extensible Flight Simulator For Deep Learning Research.** AirControl offers a realistic simulation experience with a variety of airplanes. The AirControl is built on [Unity Game engine](https://unity.com). Following are the salient features of the AirControl:

* Built with **C#**, it has **Python** API to control it from your favorite Deep learning Framework.
* Complete source code is open on Github.
* Aircontrol takes full advantage of object-oriented programming. It is developed fully modular from day one. You can easily introduce new features such as **vertical takeoff**. You can bring your own **alien plane to AirCotrol**. 
* AirControl is truly cross-platform, can be compiled on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Binary will be released for all the platforms.
* The AirControl uses Nvidia [Physx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhysX) for the best possible Newtonian physics simulation.
* AirControl allows users to take advantage of aerodynamics effects such as [Ground effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(aerodynamics)).
* All the control surfaces (Throttle, Rudder, Ailerons, and Flaps) accept normalized input between -1 and 1. This makes AirControl even more friendly with AI.

## System Requirement
It depends on how big your Unity environment is. The environment which comes with the AirControl binary releases is the basic one and tested with the following config:

- Operating System : Ubuntu, Windows, Mac
- CPU: Intel Core i7
- GPU: Nvidia 1070 or Higher
- RAM: 16 GB

AirControl may work with lower than the specified requirements, but it's not tested.

You can run AirControl in server-client mode with two different machines or both in a single machine.

## Getting started

Version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) follows Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. Version numbers change as follows:
1. MAJOR version when making incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when adding API in a backward-compatible manner
3. PATCH version when making backward-compatible bug fixes
Note that semantic versioning also applies to the Pypi release, Git release, and Snap releases.

## Client examples

| Sr. No.  |  Client Example | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Primitive API](https://github.com/snlpatel001213/AirControl/blob/master/Python/client_examples/primitive_API.ipynb)   |  Simple Client to interact with the server. It does not require the AirControl Pypi package. Just for unit test, not for long runs |
| 2 | [Primitive API - 2](https://github.com/snlpatel001213/AirControl/blob/master/Python/client_examples/primitive_API_2.ipynb)   |  Simple Client to interact with server. More detailed than the previous one. End to end flight loop is demonstrated. It does not require AirControl Pypi package. Just for unit test, not for long runs |
| 3 | [Lidar Controls](https://github.com/snlpatel001213/AirControl/blob/master/Python/client_examples/lidar_API.ipynb)   |  Demonstrate how to control lidar from the python client.|
| 4 | [Camera Controls](https://github.com/snlpatel001213/AirControl/blob/master/Python/client_examples/camera_API.ipynb)   |  Demonstrate how to control Camera from the python client. It allows switching the camera. It allows capturing Depth, Semantic segmentation, Object segmentation, Optical flow variant of the scene.|
| 4 | [Time of Day Controls](https://github.com/snlpatel001213/AirControl/blob/master/Python/client_examples/time_of_day_API.ipynb)   | Allows controlling the time of day and light conditions. It allows controlling sun position based on Longitude, Latitude, Hour, and Minutes.|
| 5 | [UI and Audio Controls](https://github.com/snlpatel001213/AirControl/blob/master/Python/client_examples/other_API.ipynb)   | Allows controlling visibility of Airplane control on UI and Airplane Audio.|
