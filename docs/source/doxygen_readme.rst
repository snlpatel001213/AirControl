**AirControl is an Open Source, Modular, Cross-Platform, and Extensible
Flight Simulator For Deep Learning Research.** Airsim offers a realistic
simulation experience with a variety of airplanes. The Airsim is built
on `Unity Game engine <https://unity.com>`__. Following are the salient
features of the Aircontrol:

-  Built with **C#**, it has **Python** API to control it from your
   favorite Deep learning Framework.
-  Complete source code is open on Github.
-  Aircontrol takes full advantage of object-oriented programming.
   Developed fully modular from day one. You can easily introduce new
   features such as **vertical takeoff**. you can bring your own **alien
   plane to AirCotrol**.
-  AirControl is truly cross-platform, can be compiled on Linux, macOS,
   and Windows. Binary will be released for all the platforms.
-  The AirControl uses Nvidia
   `Physx <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhysX>`__ for the best possible
   Newtonian physics simulation.
-  Aircontrol allows users to take advantage of aerodynamics effects
   such as `Ground
   effect <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(aerodynamics)>`__.
-  All the control surfaces (Throttle, Rudder, Ailerons, and Flaps)
   accepts normalized input between -1 and 1. This makes Aircontrol even
   more friendly with AI.

System Requirement
------------------

It depends on how big your Unity Environment is. The environmant which
comes with the Aircontrol is basic tested with following config:

1. Operating system : Ubuntu, Windows, Mac
2. CPU: Intel Core i7
3. GPU: Nvidia 1070 or Higher
4. RAM: 16 GB
5. Flight Controller: xbox [WIP]

Aircontrol may work with lower than the specified requirements, but its
not tested.

You can run Aircontrol in server client mode in 2 different machines or
both in the single machine.

Demo
----

*Current release version v0.0.3 is a pre-release to test the air
stability and controls. Python integration is still in development.*
