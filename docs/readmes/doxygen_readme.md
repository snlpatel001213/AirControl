**AirControl is an Open Source, Modular, Cross-Platform, and Extensible Flight Simulator For Deep Learning Research.** Airsim offers a realistic simulation experience with a variety of airplanes. The Airsim is built on [Unity Game engine](https://unity.com). Following are the salient features of the Aircontrol:

* Built with **C#**, it has **Python** API to control it from your favorite Deep learning Framework.
* Complete source code is open on Github.
* Aircontrol takes full advantage of object-oriented programming. Developed fully modular from day one. You can easily introduce new features such as **vertical takeoff**. you can bring your own **alien plane to AirCotrol**. 
* AirControl is truly cross-platform, can be compiled on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Binary will be released for all the platforms.
* The AirControl uses Nvidia [Physx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhysX) for the best possible Newtonian physics simulation.
* Aircontrol allows users to take advantage of aerodynamics effects such as [Ground effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(aerodynamics)).
* All the control surfaces (Throttle, Rudder, Ailerons, and Flaps) accepts normalized input between -1 and 1. This makes Aircontrol even more friendly with AI.

## System Requirement

It depends on how big your Unity Environment is. The environmant which comes with the Aircontrol is basic tested with following config: 

1. Operating system :  Ubuntu, Windows, Mac
2. CPU:  Intel Core i7
3. GPU: Nvidia 1070 or Higher
4. RAM: 16 GB
5. Flight Controller: xbox [WIP]

Aircontrol may work with lower than the specified requirements, but its not tested. 

You can run Aircontrol in server client mode in 2 different machines or both in the single machine.
